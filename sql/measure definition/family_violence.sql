Description:
An event where Police noted a person was exposed to family violence.

Intended purpose:
Identify events of exposure to family violence.
Count the number of family violence exposures for a person.
 
Notes:
1) There are multiple sources of family violence data. These include
   victims (RCVS) data from police, offenders (RCOS) data from police,
   intake records from CYF, NIA-linked data that combines emergency calls
   and police activity notes.
2) This definition only uses the NIA-linked data. This is
   certainly an under-count of incidence of family violence events.
   (Consider that the police family violence unit is called out 119k
   times per year, but this data contains only 40k records per year.)
   Corrections, MoJ charges, and Police Offender & Victim dataset also
   contain offence codes that could be used to identify family violence.
3) Offence codes that correspond to family violence were identified. They are:
    1581	COM ASSLT(DOMESTIC)CR ACT(FIREARM)
    1582	COM ASSLT(DOMESTIC)CR ACT(OTH WEAP)
    1583	COM ASSLT(DOMESTIC)CR ACT(MANUALLY)
    1587	COMMON ASSAULT (DOMESTIC) (STABBING/CUTTING WEAPON)
    1641	COMMON ASSAULT (DOMESTIC) (FIREARM)
    1642	COMMON ASSAULT (DOMESTIC) (OTHER WEAPON)
    1643	COMMON ASSAULT (DOMESTIC) (MANUALLY)
    1647	COMMON ASSAULT (DOMESTIC) (STABBING/CUTTING WEAPON)
    2654	HUSBAND RAPES WIFE
    2658	UNLAWFUL SEXUAL CONNECTION WITH SPOUSE
    3711	CRUELTY TO/ILLTREAT CHILD (CRIMES ACT)
    1D	DOMESTIC DISPUTE
   These codes have not been matched against the list of codes the NZ Police use
   when reporting on family violence. SME review is needed before this variable
   can be used for research focused on family violence.
4) We have not distinguished between different roles with respect to family
   violence (e.g. offender, victim, witness, suspect, informant, etc.).
   Hence this is only exposure.
