Inputs & Dependencies:

Outputs:
- [IDI_UserCode].[DL-MAA2020-01].[d2g_dependent_children]

Description:
The time period during which a person has living children under the age of 16.
So age 0-15 is dependent.

Intended purpose:
Counting the number of dependent children that a person has at any point in time.
 
Notes:
1) There is no control for whether a person lives with (their) children or is
   involved in their care. Only considers parents by birth so legal guardians
   can not be identified this way.

  Current refresh = 20200120
