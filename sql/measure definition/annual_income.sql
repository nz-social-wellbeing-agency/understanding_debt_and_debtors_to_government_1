Title: Tax year income summary
Author: Simon Anastasiadis
Reviewer: Marianna Pekar

Inputs & Dependencies:
- [IDI_Clean].[data].[income_tax_yr_summary]
Outputs:
- [IDI_Sandpit].[DL-MAA2020-01].[d2g_income_tax_year]

Description:
Summary of income for each tax year.

Intended purpose:
Calculating annual income from different sources and in grand total.
 
Notes:
1) Following a conversation with a staff member from IRD we were advised to use
   - IR3 data where possible.
   - PTS data where IR3 is not available
   - EMS date where IR3 and PTS are not available.
2) A comparison of total incomes from these three sources showed excellent consistency
   between [ir_ir3_gross_earnings_407_amt], [ir_pts_tot_gross_earnings_amt], [ir_ems_gross_earnings_amt]
   with more than 90% of our sample of records having identical values across all three.
3) However, rather than combine IR3, PTS and EMS ourselves we use the existing [income_tax_yr_summary]
   table as it addresses the same concern and is already a standard table.
4) Unlike EMS where W&S and WHP are reported directly, the tax year summary table re-assigns some
   W&S and WHP to the S0*, P0*, C0* categories. Hence sum(WHP) from tax year summary will not be
   consistent with sum(WHP) from IRD-EMS. You can see in the descriptions that S/C/P01 have PAYE
   and hence will (probably) appear in IRD-EMS as W&S, while S/C/P02 have WHT deducted and hence
   will (probably) appear in IRD-EMS as WHP.

Parameters & Present values:
  Current refresh = 20200120
  Prefix = d2g_
  Project schema = [DL-MAA2020-01]
 
Issues:
- IR3 records in the IDI do not capture all income reported to IRD via IR3 records. As per the data
  dictionary only "active items that have non-zero partnership, self-employment, or shareholder salary
  income" are included. So people with IR3 income that is of a different type (e.g. rental income)
  may not appear in the data.
