Description:
Summary of health and wellbeing questions from GSS 2016.

Intended purpose:
Provide indicators of general/overall wellbeing, health and material wellbeing.
  
Notes:
1) Output values for survey questions are response codes. These include non-response codes
   such as Don't Know, Refused to answer, Response Unidentifiable, and Response Out of Scope.
   Non-response codes have not been filtered out in this definition.
2) This definition is applicable to GSS 2016. Due to changes between GSS waves, care is advised
   when combining across waves that the questions are equivalent, and that the response scales
   are coded the same way.
