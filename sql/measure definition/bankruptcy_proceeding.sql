Description:
Any bankruptcy proceedings against a person, irrespective of whether they
result in the person being declared bankrupt/insolvent.

Intended purpose:
Identifying when/whether people are having trouble making repayments on their debt.
  
Notes:
1) Conversation with Joanne Butterfield (IRD) on 2020-01-08:
   - IRD applies the 'B' flag in the customers table when any bankruptcy proceedings
     are in progress. These do not always result in an insolvency (if people can
     resume making repayments or if another process is used, such as a no-asset proceedure).
   - New IRD numbers are issues when a person has completed bankruptcy/insolvency.
   Therefore
   - We use the customers table as an indication of 'trouble making repayments'
   - We use the cross-reference table to identify people declared bankrupt.
2) The New Zealand Insolvency and Trustee Service (insolvency.govt.nz) is the government
   office (part of MBIE) who handles insolvency. They distinguish between bankruptcy
   (which applies to individuals) and liquidation & receivership (which apply to companies).
   Sole traders are trated as individuals, because they are not distinct legal entities.
3) This definition is for people who have any bankruptcy proceeding against them.
